example.com/Customer/*/Purchases

Customers is a query
purchases is a query

example.com/Customers/*/Purchases?Customers.query="Active: == true"&Purchases.query="CreateDate: > 10/24/22"

example.com/Customers/*/Purchases?Customers.query=Active,Name,Zip:exclude(contains(55555))

example.com/Customers/*/Purchases?Customers.query=Active,Name,Zip:contains(55555)


required becomes default fields
dyre must have at least one default field

if a query is part of a sub query should it still generate?

INNER JOIN is implicit


SELECT PurchaseID 
FROM Purchases
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT Customrs.Active
  FROM Customers
  WHERE Customers.Active == true
) AS Customers ON Customer.CustomerID = Purchases.CustomerID
WHERE Purchases.CreateDate > GetDate()

c = dyre['Customers']
c.query = Customers.query

p = dyre['Purchases']
p.query = Purchases.Query

p.join(c, CustomerID)
p.group = Purchases.Group

query := p.generate()
